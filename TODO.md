# TODO

* [x] protect against empty (and weird?) in-place modifications
* [x] automatically add `async` for functions with `await` in them
* [x] better command line parsing
* [x] use atomic rename to prevent file truncation
* [x] support other languages
* [x] better error handling
* [ ] reconsider always wrapping (does black work the same?)
* [ ] test and lint
* [x] pip and poetry instructions

# Later

* [ ] examples for pytest, isort, autoflake
* [ ] use proper markdown parser
